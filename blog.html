       <h4>Crypto Rush</h4>
       <p>Hannah Colon/July 21, 2023 </p>
       <p> In today's class we were able to participate in a Game Jam, were we were able to create our won game in groups of three. My game was about cryptology and it was named Crypto Rush. When playing this game 2 people woudl roll the dice and draw a card with a word on it. Depending on the number they rolled they woudl choose the card of the corresponfing alphabet shifted 1-6 times. Afterwards, there would be a 5 minute timer. Each player has 5 minutes to encript as many words as they can from the deck of cards as they can. At the end of the 5 minutes they woudl accumulate the points of each word they were able to encrypt, and the player wiht the most points wins! When we were creating the game we faced about 2 challenges. The first one was that we had to write the rules on a piece of paper, and the second, instead of the player creating their own shifted alphabet, we provide the shifted alphabet to prevent any mistakes and to conserve time. If we had more time to work on the game I think we wouldn't had change a lot about it, I think we would have done it more profesionally. </p>

       <h2>Machine Learning Meme</h2>

       <p>
        Machine learning is portrayed in this meme because today, machines are all knowing and are able to retain more information a human can. They are able to completely surpass the potential of the knowledge retained by humans. With chatgpt, knowledge that humans accumulate, to some, won’t be a necessity.
