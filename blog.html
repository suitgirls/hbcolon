       <h2>Favorite Robot!</h2>
       <p>Hannah/July 25, 2023</p>
       <p>My favorite robot is Baymax from the movie Big Hero 6. Baymax is my favorite robot because, although he is very smart, he is also wholesome and innocent. Like just mentioned, when I think of Baymax I think of him as very wholesome. Thus, this has influenced my feelings towards robots because although they are incapable of feeling they don’t necessarily know what they are doing unless they are programmed to, that also makes them innocent and made me feel empathetic towards them.Those feelings didn’t really change when I met the Ray becauseI I felt empathetic towards her. However, they were never the same as they were for Baymax. In contrast, this definitely did not apply to Mid Journey AI, I think this is because it was just on the computer and not actually talking. At the end of today’s lecture I would say that my perception towards robots has changed, from “ahh” to cool. Although it will always look creepy and it is something very unexpected, I now have a better understanding and representation of what robots are and what to think of them.

       <h2>Crypto Rush</h2>
       <p>Hannah Colon/July 21, 2023 </p>
       <img src="Crypto Rush Group Photo.jpg">
       <p> In today's class we were able to participate in a Game Jam, were we were able to create our won game in groups of three. My game was about cryptology and it was named Crypto Rush. When playing this game 2 people woudl roll the dice and draw a card with a word on it. Depending on the number they rolled they woudl choose the card of the corresponfing alphabet shifted 1-6 times. Afterwards, there would be a 5 minute timer. Each player has 5 minutes to encript as many words as they can from the deck of cards as they can. At the end of the 5 minutes they woudl accumulate the points of each word they were able to encrypt, and the player wiht the most points wins! When we were creating the game we faced about 2 challenges. The first one was that we had to write the rules on a piece of paper, and the second, instead of the player creating their own shifted alphabet, we provide the shifted alphabet to prevent any mistakes and to conserve time. If we had more time to work on the game I think we wouldn't had change a lot about it, I think we would have done it more profesionally. </p>

       <h2>Machine Learning Meme</h2>
       <p>Hannah/July 20,2023</p>
       <img SRC="meme.png"> 
       <p>
        Machine learning is portrayed in this meme because today, machines are all knowing and are able to retain more information a human can. They are able to completely surpass the potential of the knowledge retained by humans. With chatgpt, knowledge that humans accumulate, to some, won’t be a necessity.
