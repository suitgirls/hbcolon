     <h1>Hannah Colon's Biography</h1>
     <p>
        Hi! My name is Hannah Colon, I'm 17 years old and going to my senior year of HS. I live in Dorado, Puerto Rico. I decided to take this class because it will help to expand my horizons in the STEM field, especially tech. I don't have any specific interests in technology, I hope to find something that sparks my interest. I am the oldest of two, and I have a pet dog called Rosita. At home, I enjoy going to the beach, playing beach tennis, and watching movies with my friends, especially rom-coms. One of my favorite movies is "How to Loose a Guy in 10 Days", I never get tired of watching it.
